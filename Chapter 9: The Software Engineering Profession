Challenges to the Profession:

In some areas we have made significant 
advancement in SE practice; however, serious 
problems in software development associated with 
cost, quality, and schedule still remain.

There is much improvement in the professional 
preparation for software engineering, but many 
academic programs in computing still devote 
insufficient attention to software engineering issues.

Although improving, many organizations still do not 
use “best practices” (or worst, they are not aware 
of best practices).

The software engineering profession is still viewed 
as immature.
